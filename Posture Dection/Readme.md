 # Posture Detection Project

  <div >
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Posture Detection</strong> project is a real-time body posture detection web application that uses your webcam to analyze body poses. By utilizing <strong>ml5.js</strong> and the <strong>BodyPose</strong> model, this project allows users to detect human body landmarks (like joints and keypoints) and visualize their posture in real-time, directly in their web browser.</p>
    
    <p>This project uses machine learning techniques, specifically <strong>BodyPose</strong>, to identify and connect the keypoints of your body, forming a skeletal structure. The project is designed to be simple to use and requires no server-side setup. It works entirely in the browser and starts detecting your body posture as soon as the webpage is opened.</p>

    <h3>Key Features:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Real-time Posture Detection</strong>: Detects your body posture using the webcam in real time.</li>
      <li><strong>Automatic Camera Start</strong>: No need to press a button to start the camera; it starts automatically when the webpage is loaded.</li>
      <li><strong>Posture Visualization</strong>: Visualizes body keypoints and connects them to form a skeleton, making it easy to see your posture.</li>
      <li><strong>No Manual Interactions</strong>: Once the page is opened, the camera starts automatically, and posture detection happens without the need for any interaction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How This Project Works</h2>
    <p>1. <strong>Automatic Webcam Activation</strong>: Upon opening the webpage, the camera feed starts automatically, and the system accesses the webcam to capture live video.</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Pose Detection Using BodyPose</strong>: The BodyPose model (via <strong>ml5.js</strong>) is used to detect key points on your body, such as shoulders, elbows, knees, and other important joints. These keypoints are used to analyze and visualize your posture.</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Posture Visualization</strong>: The application connects the detected keypoints (e.g., shoulder to elbow, knee to ankle) with lines to form a skeleton, which is displayed on the screen overlaid on your video feed.</p>
    <p>4. <strong>Real-time Updates</strong>: The posture detection updates continuously as long as the webpage is open, providing real-time feedback.</p>
    <p>5. <strong>Automatic Stop</strong>: The camera feed automatically stops when the browser window is closed.</p>

    <h2>How to Use This Project on Your Own Computer</h2>
    <p>You can easily set up and use this project on your own computer. Follow the steps below to get started:</p>

    <h3>1. Clone or Download the Repository</h3>
    <p>You can either clone the repository to your local machine using <strong>Git</strong> or download the project as a ZIP file.</p>
    
    <h4>Clone the Repository:</h4>
    <p>Open your terminal or command prompt and type the following command to clone the repository:</p>
    <code>git clone https://github.com/yourusername/posture-detection.git</code>
    
    <h4>Download as ZIP:</h4>
    <p>If you prefer not to use Git, you can download the project as a ZIP file:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Go to the <a href="https://github.com/yourusername/posture-detection" target="_blank">repository page</a>.</li>
      <li>Click on the <strong>Code</strong> button and select <strong>Download ZIP</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Open the Project in Your Web Browser</h3>
    <p>After cloning or downloading the project:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Open the folder where you cloned or extracted the project files.</li>
      <li>Find and double-click on the <strong>index.html</strong> file to open it in your web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or any modern browser is recommended).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Camera Activation</h3>
    <p>Once the webpage is opened, the camera will start automatically.</p>
    <p>The webcam feed will display in the browser, and the posture detection system will begin identifying your body’s keypoints.</p>

    <h3>4. Posture Detection in Real-Time</h3>
    <p>The system will visualize your posture by drawing a skeleton over the webcam feed. The skeleton is created by connecting the detected keypoints with lines, which represent joints and bones.</p>
    <p>You can move your body, and the system will continuously update the skeleton to show your posture.</p>

    <h3>5. Close the Browser to Stop the Camera</h3>
    <p>The camera feed will stop automatically when you close the webpage in the browser.</p>
    <p>No need to click any buttons to stop or start the camera feed—the system runs entirely on auto-mode.</p>
