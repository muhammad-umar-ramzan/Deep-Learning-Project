# Skin Cancer Detection Project
 <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This project is a deep-learning-based web application that analyzes skin images to detect signs of skin cancer. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, the tool classifies uploaded skin images as either <strong>benign</strong> or <strong>malignant</strong>, providing crucial information that can assist with early diagnosis. This project showcases the power of AI in healthcare, using technology to contribute to early cancer detection.</p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Image Upload:</strong> Users can upload a skin lesion image via the web interface.</li>
        <li><strong>Image Processing:</strong> The application preprocesses the image by resizing it to a suitable dimension required for model prediction.</li>
        <li><strong>Prediction:</strong> The deep learning model analyzes the processed image to classify it as benign or malignant.</li>
        <li><strong>Result Display:</strong> The web application displays the prediction outcome directly on the screen. If cancer is detected, the result text is highlighted in color, and suggestions are provided for medical consultation.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Project Structure</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flask Server:</strong> Manages requests and serves the frontend.</li>
        <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> HTML/CSS/JavaScript for a responsive and professional UI with hover effects, animations, and transitions.</li>
        <li><strong>Deep Learning Model:</strong> A TensorFlow/Keras model (<code>Skin_Cancer_Detector.h5</code>) trained on skin cancer images for classification.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>TensorFlow/Keras:</strong> For model creation and prediction.</li>
        <li><strong>Flask:</strong> Backend server to connect the model with the web app.</li>
        <li><strong>OpenCV:</strong> For image processing.</li>
        <li><strong>HTML/CSS/JavaScript:</strong> For the web interface and styling.</li>
    </ul>
